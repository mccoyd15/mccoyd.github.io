		<p text-align = "center"; > My name is Destiney McCoy and I am a junior Computer Science major at Berea College. I am minoring in Law, Ethics, And Society and plan to attend law school upon gradutation.
                        I am from Birmingham, AL, the home of the Civil Rights movement.
                        I want to be a role model for all the little Back girls in my community and show them that it is possible to make it out.
                        Growing up I worked at the community center and seen girls as young as 11 saying that they were not going to college.
                        To them it was never possibility because they did not have anyone to look up too. </p>

                <h2> Summer Internship </h2>
                <p>At the beginning of June, I started my virtual internship at Car Keys Express. 
                  Going into this internship, I did not know what to expect and had a lot of misconceptions.  </p>

		<p>This was a good first internship experience for me being that it was only my sophomore year. 
                   I was able to learn more about the tech world and finding solutions to problems. 
                   These are skills that will help me in the future, not only in computer science but in other areas as well.</p>
